* Containers needed
** nginx

Look at https://github.com/Bankmonitor/docker for a image and instructions on how to spin up a spring boot jar 
*** Note: must copy actual jar into docker folder, sym links don't work.

* Network
** Need to run all containers in the same network
** TODO read about networks of containers
** TODO Does docker compose do the above in a scripted way?

* TODO CI

* Deployment
** TODO Google - https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/
